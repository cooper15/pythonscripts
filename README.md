# Python scripts for the Gnu/Linux system.
System scripts written in python. Chances keyboard layout, battery low suspend system, etc.
I wrote those scripts for using them with a WM like openbox, but they can be used with any WM that doesn't has native support for change keyboard layout, suspend the system when the battery is in a low level, etc.

Be free to copy and modify them.

#Usage

1. Copy the scripts in any path that you wish example: **/home/your_user/scripts**.
2. For the keyboard layout changer is too much easy if you assign it to a keyboard shortcut like **Win + space**.
3. For the system suspend it's recommendable to put it into the autostart file in openbox or whatever WM that you use.

Enjoy :).
